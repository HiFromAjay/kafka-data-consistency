# kafka-data-consistency

Experiement with using Kafka and idempotency to garantee data consistency by creating a reactive asynchronous system.

## Installing Kafka

    wget https://www-eu.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.1.1/kafka_2.11-2.1.1.tgz
    tar -xzf kafka_2.11-2.1.1.tgz
    echo kafka_2.11-2.1.1 >> .gitignore
    rm kafka_2.11-2.1.1.tgz
    git init

## Starting Kafka with docker

The generated `maxant/kafka` image uses a shell script to append important properties to the
`config/server.properties` file in the container, so that it works.
See `start-kafka.sh` for details, including how it MUST set
`advertised.listeners` to the containers IP address, otherwise kafka has
REAL PROBLEMS.

Run `./build.sh` which builds images for Zookeeper and Kafka

Run `./run.sh` which starts Zookeeper and two Kafka brokers with IDs 1 and 2,
listening on ports 9091 and 9092 respectively.

This script passes the Zookeeper

This script also shows how to append the hosts file so that service names can
be used by applications, but it requires the user to `sudo`. It also contains
examples of waiting for Zookeeper / Kafka logs to contain certain logs before
the script continues.


## Debug Web Component

    java -Ddefault.property=asdf -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8787 -jar web/target/web-microbundle.jar

# TODO

- dev with other stuff in docker, but container can run locally?
- orientdb docker image => https://hub.docker.com/_/orientdb
- define payara config with yml
- override payara config with system props & environment
- add https://docs.payara.fish/documentation/microprofile/healthcheck.html and use it in start script?

# TODO Blog

- need lock when using transactional kafka, but not otherwise since producer is thread safe
