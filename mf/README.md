## What is The Milk Factory?

The Milk Factory is a venture where we allow customers to create contracts to order customised milk 
products, for example milkshakes. The customer can customise things like fat and sugar content, 
chocolate type, other extras and supplements.

Contracts can be one-off, subscriptions limited for a given duration, auto-extendable or not.

With a subscription you pay for say 10 per year and you can claim them when you want.

Depending upon the product, there are certain specialities, like our index based products which 
become more expensive year on year, depending upon raw product costs.
